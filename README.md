# Emergency_Food_Delivery
## Description
Prior to a pandemic, Baltimore County and Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) are preparing to deliver food to diet-sensitive and immune-compromised patients by drones, so as to reduce contact times for these patients and lessen the secondary health impact of viral infections.
Our goal in this project is to find the best way to match grocery stores and patients in Baltimore County in order to satisfy a once-per-week delivery target and minimize the operational cost.

## Organization:

All files live in the 'Operations Research Project' folder, with content organized into subfolders as follows:
 - 'Code': All coding stuff goes into this folder, including each area using 3/4/5 drones and an example of predefined route in 21239.
 - 'Data' : All data is stored in this folder, including parameters of our drone, locations of the grocery store and patients' locations in each area.
For example, “patients21239_TableToExcel.csv” contains locations of one grocery store and 20 patients.
